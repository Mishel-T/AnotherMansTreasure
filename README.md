#Another Man's Treasure

##Project 2 Application

Another Man's Treasure is a an application designed to help users declutter their lives by allowing the user to post items up for trade rather than for sale. This gives the user the opportunity to acquire something of value that they might need in exchange for soemthing they would like to get rid of without monetary exchange. It creates an ideal situation for people who may not have much money to make regular purchases, but who may have items they can offer up to trade that would benefit someone else. 

Through Another Man's Treasure, a user can create a secure account and post items up for trade by entering the item's information and uploading a picture. Users can then manage their trades through their profile to fidn the most desirable trade offers. 

Users can search on the home page for items by category or by location. Once a user has found an item they may need or want, they can offer items to trade that they have uploaded through their own profile, allowing the original poster of the item to the review the offer on their own profile.
